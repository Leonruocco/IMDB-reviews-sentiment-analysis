# IMDB-reviews-sentiment-analysis
Natural language processing sentiment analysis was performed on labelled IMDB review dataset. Supervised deep learning was performed testing various neural network models from basic dense layering, to combinations of recurrent and convolutional neural networks of varying complexity. Overfitting was mitigated, and optimimum test accuracy was achieved, with the use of dropout layers alongside custom optimisers as well as word embeddings from GloVe.
